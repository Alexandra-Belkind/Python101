### Python101 HW2 Comments

* you are asked to define some functions: `mean` (question 1), `sd` (question 2), `zscore` (question 3), `csv_parser` (question 4.1), `mean_height` (question 4.2), `occupation_distribution` (question 4.3) and `proper_title_case` (question 4.3).
* to define a function add the relevant stuff after the colon. For example, to define the function `myfunc` that returns an addition or concatenation of two arguments add `return a+b` after the colon:

```python
#function that takes 2 arguments
def myfunc(a,b):
#return the concatenation
#OR addition of those values
return a + b
```
* to check whether your function works or not, delete the comment sign before the relevant command at the very end of the file. For example, to test the `mean` function uncomment `#print mean([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])`. 
* after you finish adding to the file, rename it (python101hw2YOURNAME.py) and send it to me.

Good luck!
